Welcome to PGBM's documentation!
================================

**Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines** (PGBM) is a probabilistic
gradient boosting framework in Python based on Torch / scikit-learn, developed
by Airlab in Amsterdam. It provides the following advantages over
existing frameworks: 

- Probabilistic regression estimates instead of only point estimates. (`example <https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/torch/example01_housing_cpu.py>`__)
- Auto-differentiation of custom loss functions. (`example <https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/torch/example08_housing_autodiff.py>`__, `example <https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/torch/example10_covidhospitaladmissions.py>`__)
- Native GPU-acceleration. (`example <https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/torch/example02_housing_gpu.py>`__)
- Distributed training for CPU and GPU, across multiple nodes. (`examples <https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/torch_dist/>`__)
- Ability to optimize probabilistic estimates after training for a set of common distributions, without retraining the model. (`example <https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/torch/example07_optimizeddistribution.py>`__)

It is aimed at users interested in solving large-scale tabular
probabilistic regression problems, such as probabilistic time series
forecasting. For more details, read `our
paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01682>`__ or check out the examples in our `Github <https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm>`__ repository.
