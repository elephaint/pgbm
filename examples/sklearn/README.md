# Examples #

This folder contains examples of PGBM. The examples illustrate the following:
* Example 1: How to train PGBM on CPU.
* Example 4: How to train PGBM using a validation loop.
* Examples 5-6: How PGBM compares to other methods such as NGBoost and LightGBM.
* Example 7: How hyperparameters can be optimized.
* Example 9: How to plot the feature importance of a learner after training.
* Example 11: How to save and load a PGBM model. 
* Example 12: How to checkpoint a PGBM model. 
* Example 13: How to use monotonic constraints in a PGBM model.
* Example 14: How to PGBM compares against Quantile Regression methods.

Note: to use the `higgs` dataset in any of the examples, download [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS), unpack and save `HIGGS.csv` to your local working directory.
